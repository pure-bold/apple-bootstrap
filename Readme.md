# Apple Bootstrap

## A forgery

This is the start of a project to create Bootstrap versions of plenty of beautiful, famous Apple landing pages.

While staying close to vanilla Bootstrap in whatever version is the latest.

Now, of course not everything will be pixel-perfect, since for example Bootstrap has 5 breakpoints whereas Apple only uses 3.
Also, I don't have endless time, so not every single Animation might be implemented

Project overview / progress:
+ Apple TV App (from April 2023):
	+ Desktop version, static with 2 animations, DONE
	
Upcoming (probably / maybe):
+ iPad Air (May 2023)
